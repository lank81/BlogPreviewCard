## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

This was very similar to the first project (QR Code) so a lot of what was done before could be done for this project.  The thing that threw me off was the user avatar and name at the bottom.  I was trying to set the height/width of the image and align content to mimic the design.  After some time spent doing this unsuccessfully I googled and found info surrounding using a div (footer in my case) and setting it to flexbox row.
